DataFrames are essentially multidimensional arrays with attached row and column labels, and often with heterogeneous types and/or missing data. As well as offering a convenient storage interface for labeled data, Pandas implements a number of powerful data operations familiar to users of both database frameworks and spreadsheet programs. We will use `Pandas` as the main tool to structure, manipulate and store data throughout this course. As such Pandas constitutes a core data science library that all of you should be very well familiar with."
