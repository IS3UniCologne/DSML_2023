    "This course uses Python because it has emerged as one of the main and most solid options for Data Science, together with other free alternatives such as R. Python is widely used for data processing and analysis both in academia and in industry. There is a vibrant and growing scientific community, working at both universities and companies, that supports and enhances its capabilities for data analysis by providing new and refining existing extensions (a.ka.a. libraries, see below). All of this means that, whether you are thinking of continuing in Higher Education or trying to find a job in industry, Python will be an importan asset that employers will significantly value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a high-level language means that the code can be \"dynamically interpreted\", which means it is run on-the-fly without the need to be compiled. This is in contrast to \"low-level\" programming languages, which first need to be converted into machine code (i.e. compiled) before they can be run. With Python, one does not need to worry about compilation and can just write code, evaluate, fix it, re-evaluate it, etc. in a quick cycle, making it a very productive tool. The rest of this tutorial covers some of the basic elements of the language, from conventions like how to comment your code, to the basic data structures available.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend the following resources for further introductory reading:\n",

    "The most common \"built-in\" data types you will interact with when doing data science work are lists and dictionaries (there are of course additional types like Numpy Arrays, Pandas Dataframes, and others, but these are provided by external libraries). It's good to have a brief understanding of how to use these data structures effectively."

    "* Second, we append `()` after the name, and finish the line with a colon (`:`). This is necessary and will allow us to specify requirements for the function (see below).\n",
    "* Third, realize that everything inside a function needs to be indented. This is a core property of Python and, although some people find it odd, it enhances readibility greatly.\n",
    "* Fourth, the piece of code to do the task we want, printing the sequence of numbers, is inside the function in the same way it was outside, only properly indented.\n",
    "* Fifth, we finish the method with a line starting by `return`. In this case, we follow it with `None`, but this will change as methods become more sophisticated. Essentially, this is the part of the method where you specify which elements you want it to return and save for later use.\n",
